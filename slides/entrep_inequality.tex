\begin{itemize}
  \item What is driving the observed increase in income inequality?
  \begin{itemize}
    \smallskip
    \item Have the causes changed over time?
    \smallskip
    \item How much has each cause contributed? 
  \end{itemize}

  \bsk
  \item Empirical answers:
  \begin{itemize}
    \smallskip
    \item Technology: positive relationship (5 year lag)
    \smallskip
    \item Education: strong positive relationship (2 year lag)
    \smallskip
    \item Taxes: negative, but relatively weak relationship
    \smallskip
    \item Entrepreneurship: results vary drastically with lag length
  \end{itemize}

  \item 1990's - Is this skill-biased technological change (SBTC)? Human capital differences? Some combination?

    \smallskip
    \item Computers: Bound (AER,1992); David (QJE,1998); DiNardo and Card (JLE,2002); 
    \smallskip
    \item Human capital + SBTC: Acemoglu (QJE,1998);

    \item Finance boom/entrepreneurship: Bakija et al (WP,2012)

  \msk
  \item Accounts for issues arising from cointegrated variables
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta y_{it} = \phi_{i}\left(y_{i,t-1} - \theta_i'X_{i,t} \right) +\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \gamma^*_{ij} \Delta y_{i,t-j}+ \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \beta^{*'}_{ij} \Delta X_{i,t-j} + \alpha_i +\varepsilon_{it}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Three estimators
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed Effects (benchmark) - slope coefficients are fixed across states, intercepts vary
    \item Mean Group - average over individual state coefficients
    \item Pooled Group - long-run coefficients are fixed across states, short-run coefficients vary
